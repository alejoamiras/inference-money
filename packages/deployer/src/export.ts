The ${m.network} deployment of bridge \`${m.l2.bridge.address}\`, deployed from commit \`${m.sourceCommit}\`.

- \`manifest.json\`: every address and instance record. \`instanceFromRecord(artifact, manifest.l2.<key>)\` re-derives each
  instance and refuses an artifact that does not land on the recorded address.
- \`aztec/{proxy,token,bridge}.json\`: the Aztec contract artifacts, as compiled at that commit.
- \`ethereum/{TokenPortal,Permit2DepositRouter}.abi.json\`: the L1 functions and events an integration calls.
- \`SHA256SUMS\`: every file's sha256 (\`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS\`).

Who may do what, every refusal, the message formats and what each action makes public: \`docs/integration.md\` at that
commit. \`bun run bridge verify <manifest>\`, against your own endpoints, proves this deployment matches the manifest and
that commit's code. It cannot tell whose deployment it is: compare the manifest's USDC, Permit2 and admin with addresses
you already trust first.

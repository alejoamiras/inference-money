/**
 * The merchant token's request stamps, paid marker, hint capsule slots and request effect: the TS mirror of
 * `contracts/aztec/merchant_stamp`.
 *
 * Opening a request (a partial note's commitment `c`) pushes `stamp(c, b)`, `b` the hour its anchor block falls in, when
 * the recipient is proven a merchant, and `pad(c)` otherwise. A user may pay only into a request whose stamp is still
 * live, at most until its deadline a day later; every payment pushes `paid(c)`, so a request takes one. The token
 * pushes all three unsiloed, so on chain each appears siloed with the token's address.

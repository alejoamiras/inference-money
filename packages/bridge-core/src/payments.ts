/**
 * Payment requests on the merchant token: open one, find its stamp, and pay it at most once from one client.
 *
 * A request is a partial note's commitment. The token takes one payment into it, refusing a second only once it reaches
 * the chain, after its proof (and, publicly, its fee). `payRequest` therefore refuses a request completed on chain, or
 * one this client has paid or is paying, through one {@link PaymentRecord} per request in an injected
 * {@link PaymentStore}:
 * - `reserved`, under the store's lock before anything is simulated; a failure before the send releases it;
 * - `sent`, written by the {@link PaymentGate}, whose node the payer's wallet must be built on, between proving and the
 *   node receiving the tx, with the tx's hash and expiry. Only finalized chain state moves it on: to `paid` with the
 *   tx, or released once the tx's revert, or the chain passing its expiry without it, is final. So an uncertain send
 *   never allows a second one;
 * - `paid`;
 * - `replaced`, by the request opened in place of a stale one ({@link payReplacingStale}), which every later attempt
 *   on the stale one shares.
 * Clients that share no store (two devices) can still both prove a payment; the token lands one.
 *
 * A private payment through a stamp caps the tx's expiry at the stamp's deadline. While the stamp is fresh that cap is
 * above the expiry every tx commits; later, the shorter expiry would tell an observer the request's age. So a user's
 * private payment through a stamp no longer fresh is refused as `stale`: before proving, and at the gate on the proven
 * tx's committed expiry, which is the guarantee.
